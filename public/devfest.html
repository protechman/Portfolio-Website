                         <p> Atlasglobal has passengers from a variety of domains, analyzing the user segments and using these segments to create the Personas was a quite difficult task for me.

                        <p> During this process, I also started to analyze the current user flows on the website and the apps. My first step was reviewing booking, check-in and manage booking steps by myself. The next step was making the same process with real users. I and my team-mates conducted interviews with 15 different passengers who have been flying with both Atlasglobal and other airlines to observe and learn their paths on the website and the apps.</p>

We needed to find the pain-points during all the journey and the best way to do that was having interviews of all the parties of the flow from Call Center representatives to counter crew in the airport and also 3rd party travel agencies. So, we spend 3 days at the call centre listening to the passengers and learning from their experiences, spent 2 days at the airport to observe passengers interacting with kiosk devices and waiting on the Counter lines. Also, went to the 3rd party agencies to learn their sales flow and passenger communications.</p>
                 <p> This interviews showed us we needed to create a rich Support Platform and clear explanations during the Check-in, Booking and Manage Booking Flows.¬†</p>
